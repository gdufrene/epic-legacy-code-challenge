# Hidden Plans

Four hidden plans are described below. They are sorted by difficulty of implementation.

## Philosopher's stone

The famous Wizard Killer Leaks website just published the secret documents of the alchemists, including the transmutation circle of the Philosopher's Stone!

Expect to see these valued items come very soon in the inventories of your customers!

As a reminder, in contact with this divine artifact, **nothing is created, nothing is lost: no object is altered.**

Code name: `Philosopher’s stone`

## Conjured objects

We observe an increase of conjured objects on the market. These items may appear from the ether contained in the air.

Unfortunately the ether evaporates quickly and **the object degrades twice as fast as normal.**

Tip: Conjured items contain the `Conjured mention` in their name

## Quality and item’s owner

Due to many complaints about the quality of the items that belonged to certain categories of population, the Host Guild decided to change some of the calculation rules.

From the next lunar cycle:
  * If the item belonged to a Barbarian, then **its quality decreases twice as fast**
  * If the item was owned by a Wizard, then **its quality increases twice as fast**

## The Unobtainium

A field of Unobtainium has been discovered on the borders of the kingdom of Azeroth.

This is an extremely rare metal that has **the characteristic of absorbing the quality that other objects nearby lose.**

The first items in Unobtainium should appear in the inventories soon, be ready!

Tip: the material of an `Unobtainium` object is specified in its name
