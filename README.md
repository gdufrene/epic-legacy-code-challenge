## Requirements

Node.js v6+ is required to run the game.

## Participant's Readme

You have just been hired by Paladin Inventories Company which makes a lot of money with its software. This start-up evaluates the quality of the objects it has in stock, because this quality evolves over time. Sadly, the goblin who wrote this software was devoured by a dragon. You do not understand anything about the code. And of course there are no tests.

The problem: a horde of trolls is rushing towards you with lots of new requests for this software, which is now yours...

Does this situation recall you something?

Let us fake this situation, in teams and in competition! Your goal is to be the fastest team to implement new features.

Who will be the best team to improve the legacy code, while still making money?

Come take up the challenge, with your favourite dev environment!
